# Hypergen V8 Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Transform Hypergen into the definitive template-based code generation solution through the revolutionary V8 architecture, surpassing Yeoman with superior composability, developer experience, and modern tooling.

## V8 Architecture Foundation

This roadmap implements the **V8 Architecture** design (see `docs/V8 Architecture.md`), built on three core concepts:
- **Templates**: Atomic content units with URL-based composability
- **Actions**: Decorator-based transformation functions  
- **Generators**: Packages containing auto-discovered templates and actions

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core V8 Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal**: Implement the basic V8 architecture with template.yml parsing and composability

#### 1.1 Template Configuration System
- [ ] Implement `template.yml` parser with full Moon configuration support
- [ ] Add variable system with rich types (string, boolean, number, enum, array)
- [ ] Implement variable validation and prompting logic
- [ ] Support internal vs. public variable distinction

#### 1.2 Template Composability Engine
- [ ] Implement `includes` functionality for URL-based template composition
- [ ] Add URL template resolver (GitHub, Gist, HTTP, local file support)
- [ ] Create variable mapping system between composed templates
- [ ] Implement template caching and integrity verification

#### 1.3 Generator Auto-Discovery
- [ ] Auto-discover templates by scanning for `template.yml` files
- [ ] Implement decorator-based action system with `@action`
- [ ] Create action parameter handling (CLI args + prompts)
- [ ] Add generator configuration loading and validation

#### 1.4 Updated Command Interface
- [ ] Implement `hypergen run <template>` with URL support
- [ ] Add `hypergen action <action>` execution
- [ ] Create `hypergen compose` for on-the-fly template combination
- [ ] Implement `hypergen list` for discovery

### Phase 2: Enhanced Developer Experience (Weeks 4-5)
**Goal**: Add development tools and workflow improvements

#### 2.1 Development Tools
- [ ] Template hot-reloading during development
- [ ] Template preview mode (`hypergen preview <template>`)
- [ ] Template validation and linting (`hypergen validate`)
- [ ] Generator testing framework with assertions

#### 2.2 File-based Routing
- [ ] Automatic `to:` path generation based on file structure
- [ ] Configurable file naming conventions
- [ ] Dynamic routing with variable interpolation
- [ ] Partial file filtering system

#### 2.3 CLI Experience Improvements  
- [ ] Interactive template discovery with fuzzy search
- [ ] Better help system with examples and usage patterns
- [ ] Improved error messages with actionable solutions
- [ ] Template debugging capabilities

#### 2.4 Migration & Compatibility
- [ ] Yeoman → Hypergen migration tool
- [ ] EJS → LiquidJS template converter  
- [ ] Hygen → V8 migration utilities
- [ ] Backward compatibility validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Composition Features (Weeks 6-7)
**Goal**: Implement advanced template composition and ecosystem features

#### 3.1 Enhanced Template System
- [ ] Template inheritance conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Conditional template inclusion based on variables
- [ ] Template versioning and dependency management
- [ ] Shared template library support

#### 3.2 Action System Enhancements
- [ ] Post-generation hooks and lifecycle management
- [ ] Cross-action communication and state sharing
- [ ] Action composition and pipelines
- [ ] Built-in actions (install-packages, format-code, etc.)

#### 3.3 Generator Registry & Distribution
- [ ] Local generator scanning and discovery
- [ ] Remote generator installation and caching
- [ ] Generator versioning with semver support
- [ ] Template security validation

### Phase 4: Ecosystem & Tooling (Weeks 8-10)
**Goal**: Build ecosystem, IDE integration, and production readiness

#### 4.1 IDE Integration
- [ ] VS Code extension for template development
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for `.liquid` and `template.yml` files
- [ ] IntelliSense for template variables and functions
- [ ] Template debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection

#### 4.2 Template Ecosystem
- [ ] Community template registry and discovery
- [ ] Template sharing via GitHub/npm integration
- [ ] Template validation and quality scoring
- [ ] Best practices documentation and examples

#### 4.3 Performance & Production Features
- [ ] Comprehensive benchmark suite vs. Yeoman
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for large generator sets
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing
- [ ] Production deployment tools and CI/CD integration

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- **Startup Speed**: 3x faster than Yeoman for common operations
- **Template Composition**: Support 100+ composed templates without performance degradation
- **Memory Efficiency**: 50% lower memory usage vs. current Hypergen
- **Reliability**: 99.9% test coverage for core V8 functionality

### Developer Experience
- **Learning Curve**: New users productive within 10 minutes
- **Template Creation**: 5x faster template development with V8 composability
- **Migration**: One-command migration from Yeoman/Hygen
- **Error Recovery**: Zero-config debugging with clear error messages

### Ecosystem Growth
- **Adoption**: 1000+ templates using V8 architecture within 6 months
- **Community**: 50+ community-contributed templates
- **Integration**: VS Code extension with 10k+ downloads
- **Documentation**: 95% of features covered with examples

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Documentation Structure
As features are implemented, we'll create focused technical documents:

### Implementation Principles

1. **Architecture First**: All features must align with V8 architecture principles
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing templates where possible
3. **Performance Focus**: Every feature must meet performance benchmarks
4. **Documentation Driven**: Technical docs created alongside implementation
5. **Test Coverage**: 95%+ test coverage for all new V8 features

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **URL Resolution Security**: Implement content verification and sandboxing
- **Template Composition Complexity**: Comprehensive conflict resolution strategies  
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking and optimization
- **Breaking Changes**: Semantic versioning with deprecation warnings

#### Adoption Risks
