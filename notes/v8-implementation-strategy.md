# V8 Implementation Strategy

## Documentation Organization

### 1. Architecture Document (`docs/V8 Architecture.md`)
- **Purpose**: Describes "what" and "why" of V8 architecture
- **Content**: Conceptual design, relationships, mental models
- **Scope**: No implementation details or timelines

### 2. Roadmap Document (`docs/V8 Roadmap.md`)  
- **Purpose**: Implementation timeline and feature prioritization
- **Content**: 10-week phase plan, success metrics, risk mitigation
- **Features**: Incorporates best of old roadmap (IDE, file-routing, migration)

### 3. Technical Implementation Framework
- **Technical Docs**: `docs/technical/` - detailed "how" documents
- **Examples**: `docs/examples/` - practical usage patterns  
- **Structure**: Standardized templates for consistency

## Implementation Process

For each roadmap feature:
1. **Create technical doc first** using standard template
2. **Design interfaces** and get architectural feedback
3. **Implement with comprehensive tests** 
4. **Add practical examples** to examples directory
5. **Update roadmap status** and documentation

## Phase 1 Priority (Weeks 1-3)

### Critical Path Features
1. **Template Configuration System** - `template.yml` parsing with rich variables
2. **Template Composability Engine** - URL-based `includes` functionality  
3. **Generator Auto-Discovery** - Scan for templates, decorator-based actions
4. **Updated Command Interface** - Support V8 architecture commands

### Implementation Order
1. Start with Template Configuration (foundation for everything)
2. Build Variable System (needed for composition)
3. Add URL Resolution (enables composability)
4. Implement Action Decorators (completes V8 foundation)

## Success Metrics for Phase 1
- Template.yml parsing with all variable types working
- Basic URL template inclusion functional
- Auto-discovery finding templates and actions
- CLI commands working with V8 syntax

## Documentation Standards
- All new code must have corresponding technical documentation
- Examples must be tested and work as documented
- Performance benchmarks for new features
- Migration paths documented for breaking changes

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Comprehensive test coverage (95%+) for new features
- Security validation for URL resolution
- Performance benchmarking against current version

This strategy ensures we build V8 systematically with excellent documentation and maintainability.
