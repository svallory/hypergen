# Progress Tracker

## Project Status: Phase 1 - Foundation

### Completed Tasks âœ…
- Initial codebase analysis and understanding
- Created CLAUDE.md with development guidance
- Researched LiquidJS and Moon template.yml format
- Created comprehensive roadmap document
- Set up notes folder for decision tracking

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish template engine abstraction and LiquidJS integration

#### Phase 1 Tasks:
- [ ] 1.1 Template Engine Architecture
  - [ ] Create `TemplateEngine` interface and plugin system
  - [ ] Implement `LiquidTemplateEngine` class
  - [ ] Maintain `EJSTemplateEngine` for compatibility
  - [ ] Add engine detection and selection logic

- [ ] 1.2 LiquidJS Integration
  - [ ] Install and configure LiquidJS dependency
  - [ ] Implement LiquidJS rendering in `render.ts`
  - [ ] Add Liquid-specific helpers and filters
  - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for LiquidJS templates

- [ ] 1.3 Backward Compatibility
  - [ ] Ensure existing EJS templates continue working
  - [ ] Add migration warnings and guidance
  - [ ] Update documentation with engine selection

### Next Steps
1. Commit initial analysis and roadmap
2. Install LiquidJS dependency
3. Design and implement TemplateEngine interface
4. Create LiquidJS implementation
5. Add tests and documentation

### Key Decisions Made
- Plugin-based template engine architecture
- LiquidJS as default engine with EJS compatibility
- Gradual migration strategy with backward compatibility
- Support for both template.yml and existing configuration formats

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Performance**: Continuous benchmarking during implementation
- **Compatibility**: Extensive testing with existing templates
- **Migration**: Provide clear migration paths and tooling

### Success Metrics for Phase 1
- LiquidJS templates render correctly
- EJS templates continue working without changes
- Template engine selection works automatically
- Performance matches or exceeds current implementation
