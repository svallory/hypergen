# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing the remaining uncompleted roadmap items from Hypergen's existing roadmap, transitioning from npm/yarn to Bun for package management and tooling, updating the README to position Hypergen as its own independent project, and resolving merge conflicts from the multiple-template-directories feature branch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on Hypergen, I want to use Bun for all package management and tooling operations, so that I can benefit from faster performance and modern JavaScript tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run package management commands THEN the system SHALL use Bun instead of npm/yarn
2. WHEN I run build scripts THEN the system SHALL use Bun for bundling operations
3. WHEN I run tests THEN the system SHALL use Bun as the test runner
4. WHEN I install dependencies THEN the system SHALL use bun install
5. IF publishing to npm is required THEN the system SHALL still use npm publish for compatibility
6. WHEN I view package.json scripts THEN they SHALL use bun commands instead of npm/yarn

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a contributor to the project, I want the README to reflect Hypergen as an independent project, so that the project identity is clear and properly acknowledges its origins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the README THEN it SHALL present Hypergen as its own project, not a fork
2. WHEN I reach the end of the README THEN it SHALL acknowledge that Hypergen started as a fork of Hygen
3. WHEN I see the acknowledgment THEN it SHALL thank the original Hygen authors
4. WHEN I view project branding THEN it SHALL use Hypergen terminology throughout
5. WHEN I see installation instructions THEN they SHALL reference hypergen package name
6. WHEN I see command examples THEN they SHALL use hypergen instead of hygen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the multiple-template-directories feature branch properly merged into main, so that the codebase has a clean linear history and includes the new functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rebase is complete THEN all merge conflicts SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN I view git history THEN it SHALL show a linear progression without merge commits
3. WHEN I run tests THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN I use multiple template directories THEN the new feature SHALL work as intended
5. WHEN the rebase is pushed THEN the main branch SHALL contain all feature commits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project documentation updated to reflect Hypergen's independent status, so that users understand this is no longer positioned as a fork but as its own project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the README introduction THEN it SHALL present Hypergen as an independent code generator tool
2. WHEN I see installation instructions THEN they SHALL reference the hypergen package name
3. WHEN I view command examples THEN they SHALL use hypergen instead of hygen commands
4. WHEN I reach the acknowledgments section THEN it SHALL thank the original Hygen authors and acknowledge the project's origins
5. WHEN I see badges and links THEN they SHALL point to the hypergen repository and package
